# storage service

Turms itself does not directly provide storage services, but opens common interfaces in storage services on the server side for developers to implement themselves, and the Turms client also provides the corresponding storage service `turmsClient.storageService` API , for developers to call by themselves.

Notice:

* Developers can completely implement a set of interactive storage logic between the application client and your own server without any interface provided by the Turms client and server. Turms just maintains a set of implementations of common storage services, so that most developers don't have to develop from scratch. Even if the developer does not intend to use Turms' storage implementation, since each storage service implementation is similar, developers can refer to the Turms storage implementation process to implement their own storage logic to save time for self-development.
* The function provided by the Turms client storage service is a superset of the functions of the official storage service plug-in of the Turms server, namely: the Turms client storage service is designed to interact with the official storage service plug-in of the Turms server, and can also be extended to interact with other third-party plugins to interact.

## Plugin interface and configuration

Storage resources are currently divided into three types, namely: `User Profile Picture` (user profile picture), `Group Profile Picture` (group profile picture) and `Message Attachment` (message attachment). Each resource has its corresponding three function interfaces for adding (modifying), deleting, and checking for developers to implement.

## Official plugin implementation

### Bucket Basic Design Guidelines

Since the functions provided by the object storage service are similar, the official plug-ins based on the object storage service provided by Turms at present and in the future will follow the following Bucket design guidelines.

As mentioned above, Turms currently includes three types of storage resources, namely `User Profile Picture` (user profile picture), `Group Profile Picture` (group profile picture) and `Message Attachment` (message attachment), which correspond to The bucket names are `user-profile-picture`, `group-profile-picture` and `message-attachment` respectively. in:

* `user-profile-picture` and `group-profile-picture` are public Buckets. For the URLs of these resources, Turms not only supports the generation of regular URLs to allow the client to predict resource URLs by itself, avoiding sending requests to the Turms server to query resource URLs, but also supports the generation of irregular URLs for anti-crawlers. Which URL your application needs to use depends on your product requirements.
* `message-attachment` is a private Bucket that provides authorized users with a URL for temporary access to message attachments through Presigned URLs.
* The upload process of all resources is based on providing authorized users with a temporary Multipart Upload interface through the Presigned URL.

Of course, the above are only the default configurations. The current mainstream object storage services support many practical features, such as separate storage of hot and cold data (such as Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering Storage Class), encryption, complex permission control, etc., users can create in Turms On the basis of Buckets, further configuration is performed through the object storage service.

###turms-plugin-minio

#### Introduction

turms-plugin-minio is a turms-service storage service implementation plugin developed based on the open source object storage service [MinIO](https://min.io).

#### Install

* [Download and installation of MinIO server](https://min.io/download)
* [How to load the plugin](https://turms-im.github.io/docs/server/development/plugin.html#%E6%8F%92%E4%BB%B6%E5%8A%A0%E8 %BD%BD%E6%96%B9%E5%BC%8F)

After the plug-in is `Started` on the server side, the client can call the corresponding API under `turmsClient.storageService` to add, delete, modify, and query storage resources.

#### Precautions when the client calls the storage-related interface

Since the storage interface of the Turms client adopts a general-purpose interface design and is not customized for turms-plugin-minio, you need to pay attention to the following when calling the client API:

* When calling the `queryMessageAttachment` interface, the parameter `fetchDownloadInfo` must be `true`; when calling the `queryMessageAttachmentDownloadInfo` interface, the parameter `fetch` must be `true`.

#### Permission Control

* View message attachments

  * Regardless of whether users who send message attachments log out of the private chat or group chat session, they always have the right to query the message attachments they uploaded.

    And even if the user who uploaded the message attachment exits the session, all other users in the session still have the right to view the message attachment uploaded by the user.

  * Users have and can only view message attachments shared by other users in the private chat or group chat session they have joined. In other words, if a user joins a session and then logs out, the logged out user cannot view attachments in that session. Only when the user joins the session again can he have the right to view the attachments in the session again.

#### Safety

Upload limit: TODO

#### Store file data verification

If the data verification of stored files is implemented based on cloud services, the implementation of the logic will be relatively simple. For example, on AWS, you can trigger a custom Lambda function to verify the data uploaded by the user through the S3 event notification, or add a Lambda@Edge function that listens to the `origin-response` event on the CloudFront side for verification, except The custom verification logic needs to write some codes, and other functions can basically be realized by clicking the mouse.

However, as an independent storage service, MinIO does not support serverless architecture features such as Lambda functions. Compared with serverless solutions, it is much more troublesome to implement low-cost and highly available data verification logic based on MinIO's event mechanism. Therefore, Turms does not currently support data verification of stored files. Support will follow.
