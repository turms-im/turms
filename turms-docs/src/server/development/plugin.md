# Custom Plugins

## List of plugin extension points

| Category | Extension | Description |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- -------- | ----------------------------------------- ------------------- |
| Admin class | AdminActionHandler | Admin action handler. Used to monitor the administrator's API operations |
| User class | UserAuthenticator | User login authentication. When the client requests turms-gateway to log in, turms-gateway will call the plugin to implement custom login authentication logic. With this plugin, you don't need to (optionally) synchronize user information in your business system to Turms |
| | UserOnlineStatusChangeHandler | User Online Status Change Handler. When any user enters the online or offline state, turms-gateway will call this interface |
| Request class | ClientRequestHandler | Client service request handler. Used to modify request parameters (even transform into other business requests) and implement custom requests. This Handler will be called when turms receives a client service request. Through this plug-in, you can implement sensitive word filtering and other functions |
| Notification and message class | NotificationHandler | Notification Handler. When a behavior needs to be notified to relevant users, turms-gateway will call this Handler. Commonly used to integrate custom third-party push services |
| | ExpiredMessageDeletionNotifier | Expired message auto-deletion notification handler. When Turms automatically and regularly deletes expired messages, the Turms server will call this interface to inform the plug-in implementer of all messages to be deleted. Commonly used for developer backup messages |
| Service implementation class | StorageServiceProvider | Storage service provider. The Turms project itself does not have a specific implementation of storage services, but only exposes storage service-related interfaces for the plug-in to implement. (Refer to turms-plugin-minio) |
| Business Model Lifecycle Class (TODO) | | |

## Plugin loading method

* Local loading: The Turms server will detect whether the JAR package ending with `.jar` file name and the JavaScript file ending with `.js` file name in the `plugins` directory of the release package are plug-in implementations. If it is a plug-in, They will be loaded when the Turms server starts.

  Note: The Turms server will not load plugins stored in the `lib` directory.

* Load via HTTP interface:

    * Add the API interface of the Java plugin: `POST /plugins/java`
    * Add the API interface of the JavaScript plugin: `POST /plugins/js`

  Expanded information: [Plug-in related API interface](https://turms-im.github.io/docs/server/development/plugin.html#%E6%8F%92%E4%BB%B6%E7%9B%B8 %E5%85%B3api%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%A3)

* Loading via turms-admin (based on "loading via HTTP"): On the `/cluster/plugin` page, administrators can also upload Java plug-ins and JavaScript plug-ins through the UI.

## Plugin implementation

The Turms server supports plug-in implementations based on JVM or JavaScript language.

| | JVM language plugin | JavaScript plugin |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- -------------------- | ----------------------------- ---------------------------------- |
| Language Version | Java 17 (Bytecode 61.0) | ECMAScript 2022 |
| Advantages | It is suitable for implementing functions with complex logic. <br />For example, the official plugin of the Turms project `turms-plugin-antispam` sensitive word filter plug-in | Just create a new JavaScript file, you can directly write custom logic, no need to compile, no need to package;<br />It is convenient to support hot update |
| Disadvantages| If you just implement a little custom logic, you still need to build a plug-in project first, and then package the code into a Jar package based on the construction tool. The process is cumbersome| If you need to implement complex logic, it is better to implement it based on Java plug-ins;<br / >The memory overhead is larger than the Java plug-in;<br />interpretation and execution, low operating efficiency |
| General Comments | It is more suitable for plug-ins that are complex, heavy-weight, and relatively fixed. <br />This type of plug-in is more like a "project" | It is more suitable for small and lightweight plug-ins that need to support hot updates. <br />This type of plugin is more like a "small patch" |

### JVM language version (take Java as an example)

#### Implementation steps

1. Install the JAR package dependencies of the Turms project for use when compiling your plugin

    * Clone Turms' warehouse. Reference command: `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/turms-im/turms.git`
    * In the root directory of the Turms project (that is, the parent directory of the `.git` directory), execute the `mvn install -DskipUTs -DskipITs -DskipSTs` command to compile the Turms project source code, and automatically install the generated JAR package to the local In the Maven repository, for your plug-in compilation

2. Build the plug-in project

    * Option 1 (recommended): Clone the `turms/turms-plugin-demo` directory to the local, and develop based on this template. This solution can reduce unnecessary repeated configuration work.
    * Option 2: Manual construction. Specific steps are as follows:

        1. Create a new Maven project and add dependencies in `pom.xml` (to implement the turms-gateway server plug-in, add turms-gateway dependencies. To implement turms-service plug-ins, add turms-service dependencies):

           ```xml
           <dependency>
               <groupId>im.turms</groupId>
               <artifactId>turms-gateway</artifactId>
               <version>0.10.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
               <scope>provided</scope>
           </dependency>
            
           <dependency>
               <groupId>im.turms</groupId>
               <artifactId>turms-service</artifactId>
               <version>0.10.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
               <scope>provided</scope>
           </dependency>
           ```

        2. (Optional) Add `maven-shade-plugin` to package the plugin into uber JAR package. If you do not want to package dependent JAR packages, you do not need to add this plugin, but you need to confirm that the dependent packages used by the plugin already exist in the Turms server.

           ```xml
           <plugin>
               <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
               <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
               <version>3.4.0</version>
               <executions>
                   <execution>
                       <phase>package</phase>
                       <goals>
                           <goal>shade</goal>
                       </goals>
                       <configuration>
                           <outputDirectory>${project.build.outputDirectory}</outputDirectory>
                           <!-- Prevent generating the "original" jar file -->
                           <finalName>${project.artifactId}-${project.version}</finalName>
                           <minimizeJar>true</minimizeJar>
                       </configuration>
                   </execution>
               </executions>
           </plugin>
           ```

        3. In the `resources` directory, create a new file named `plugin.yaml`, and add the following plug-in description information (the specific parameter value is the information of your custom plug-in)

           ```yaml
           id: com.mydomain.MyPlugin
           class: com.mydomain.MyPlugin
           version: 0.0.1
           provider: com.mydomain
           license: MIT
           description: ''
           ```
           in:

            * The `id` field is used to distinguish plugins. No format requirements, but must not be empty
            * The `class` field is used to guide the Turms server to load the `TurmsPlugin` implementation class in the JAR package, and must not be empty
            * The other fields are used for description and have no practical function at the moment, all of them can be empty

3. Create a new class that inherits from `TurmsPlugin`, such as `public class MyPlugin extends TurmsPlugin`, and then you can write the plug-in implementation.

   in:

    * The custom subclass of `TurmsPlugin` is the entry class of the plugin, and must have a public no-argument constructor. Under the guidance of `plugin.yaml`, the Turms server will find this class and initialize it
    * `TurmsPlugin` comes with a function `getExtensions()` for the specified `TurmsExtension` class. It is used to guide the Turms server to load and initialize the custom `TurmsExtension` implementation in the plugin
    * `TurmsExtension` is the concrete implementation class of extended function points, a `TurmsExtension` can `implement` one or more `ExtensionPoint`, and must have a public no-argument constructor
    * `ExtensionPoint` is the interface of specific extended function points defined by the Turms server, such as `UserAuthenticator` and `ClientRequestHandler`

4. (Optional) Create a plug-in configuration class, write the configuration required by the plug-in, and configure the `org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties` annotation to define the configuration name prefix. Afterwards, you can initialize and automatically populate the configuration class through the `loadProperties` function under the implementation class of `TurmsExtension`.

   Take specific code as an example:

    ```java
    public class MyPlugin extends TurmsPlugin {
        @Override
        public Set<Class<? extends TurmsExtension>> getExtensions() {
            return Set.of(MyStorageServiceProvider.class);
        }
    }
   
    public class MyStorageServiceProvider extends TurmsExtension implements StorageServiceProvider {
        @Override
        public void onStarted() {
            MyPluginProperties properties = loadProperties(MyPluginProperties. class);
            // your business logic
        }
        // your business logic. e.g.:
        // Mono<Void> deleteResource(Long requesterId, ContentType contentType, String keyStr, keyNum) {
        // return Mono. empty();
        // }
    }
   
    @ConfigurationProperties("my-plugin")
    @Data
    public class MyPluginProperties {
        private String whatever = "default";
    }
    ```

5. Use construction tools (such as Maven and Gradle) to compile and package the source code into a JAR package, and put the JAR package into the `plugins` directory of the Turms server. Note that Turms does not support loading JARs in the `plugins` subdirectory.

   The directory structure in the plug-in JAR package is similar to:

    ```text
    ├─plugin.yaml
    ├─META-INF
    │ └─MANIFEST.MF
    └─com
      └─mydomain
        ├─MyStorageServiceProvider.class
        ├─MyPlugin.class
        └─MyPluginProperties.class
    ```

Precautions:

* The Turms server will only detect whether the JAR package ending with `.jar` file name in the `plugins` directory is a plug-in implementation, so if you put the plug-in JAR package in the `lib` directory, these plug-ins will not be identified and used.
  *Turms does not implement access control for plugins, you need to ensure that there is no malicious code in the plugin. Note: Malicious plug-ins can not only call functions to directly force the shutdown of the Turms server, but can even directly control the operating system.
* Since the Turms server will be introduced into the Valhalla project in the future, the development process needs to pay special attention not to use the `synchronized` keyword to lock the objects of the eight basic packaging classes, otherwise an exception will be thrown directly.

#### Class Loader

The plugin classloader on the Turms server uses a parent-first classloading mechanism. Specifically, when a plug-in implementation needs to use a class (such as third-party dependent classes: SLF4J, Netty, etc.), the plug-in class loader will delegate the loading of the class to the parent class loader, so that the parent class loader will try to load first , implemented as a shared class with the host Turms server. If the host Turms server does not have the implementation of the dependency, then try to load the class implementation in the plug-in JAR package. If there is no implementation of this class in the plugin JAR package, a `NoClassDefFoundError` exception will be thrown.

If there is an incompatibility conflict between the version of the third-party dependency package used by the plugin and the version of the dependency package used by the host Turms server, the plugin developer can pass the [Relocating Classes](https://maven .apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/examples/class-relocation.html) method to resolve dependency package conflicts.

Replenish:

* Because each plugin uses an independent plugin class loader, the classes in the plugin JAR package will only be used by the current plugin, and will not be used internally by other plugins or the host Turms server.
* The reason why Turms does not use the child-first class loading mechanism is: if the class loader of the plug-in first loads the classes in the plug-in JAR package, when these classes are passed to the host Turms server, because these classes with the same fully qualified name They are respectively loaded by the class loader of the plug-in and the class loader (ie application class loader) used by the host Turms server, so the JVM will throw `java.lang.LinkageError`.

#### Plug-in Debug steps (based on IntelliJ IDEA)

1. Under your plug-in project, press `Ctrl + F9` to automatically compile and package your plug-in JAR package to `<your plug-in project root directory>/target` directory

2. Under the `turms-server-common` project, change the `getPluginDir` function implementation in the `im.turms.server.common.infra.plugin.PluginManager` class to:

    ```java
    private Path getPluginDir(Path home, String pluginsDir) {
        return Path.of("<your plugin project root directory>/target");
    }
    ```

3. Put a breakpoint on your plugin source code

4. Start the turms-service or turms-gateway server through IDEA, the server will automatically load the plug-in JAR package in `<your plug-in project root directory>/target`, and when the server executes to the breakpoint of your plug-in source code , IDEA will suspend the running of the server for you to debug

### JavaScript version

In order to realize the Java plug-in, an engineering environment is required, and to realize the JavaScript plug-in, only a new JavaScript file needs to be created.

#### Implementation steps

Take the implementation of the `StorageServiceProvider` plugin as an example:

```javascript
class MyTurmsExtension extends TurmsExtension {
     getExtensionPoints() {
         return ['im.turms.plugin.MyExtensionPoint'];
     }

     testBool() {
         return true;
     }

     async testNotification(builders) {
         const builder = builders. get(0);
         const notification = builder. setCode(123)
             .setReason('reason')
             .build();
         const List = Java. type('java. util. List');
         return await List.of(notification);
     }
}

class MyTurmsPlugin extends TurmsPlugin {
     getDescriptor() {
     return {
         id: 'com.mydomain.myplugin',
version: '0.0.1',
     provider: 'com.mydomain',
         license: 'MIT',
description: ''
     };
}

     getExtensions() {
         return [MyTurmsExtension];
     }
}

export default MyTurmsPlugin;
```

in:

* The `MyTurmsExtension` class is a developer-defined extension of `TurmsExtension`, and the developer can customize the class name. in:
    * The `getExtensionPoints` function must exist and is used to return the names of the extension points implemented by the extension class. If the developer specifies an extension point but does not implement the interface function of the extension point, the Turms server will skip the plug-in when executing the plug-in callback function without reporting an error.

* The `MyTurmsPlugin` class is a developer-defined `TurmsPlugin` plugin, and the developer can customize the class name. in:
    * The `getDescriptor` function must exist, and the object it returns is the description information of the plug-in:
        * The `id` field is used to distinguish plugins. No format required, but must not be empty.

        * The other fields are used for description and have no practical function at the moment, so they can all be empty.

    * The `getExtensions` function must exist, and the object it returns is an array of extension classes, such as `MyTurmsExtension` above.

* `export default` is used to export developer-defined plugins, such as `MyTurmsPlugin` above.

Precautions:

* The Turms server will only detect whether the files ending with `.js` in the `plugins` directory are plug-in implementations, so if you put the plug-in JAR package in the `lib` directory, these plug-ins will not be Identify and use.
  *Turms does not implement access control for plugins, you need to ensure that there is no malicious code in the plugin. Note: Malicious plug-ins can not only call functions to directly force the shutdown of the Turms server, but can even directly control the operating system.
* The context environment is in the unit of plug-in, that is, each plug-in has its own independent context, and all functions of a plug-in share one context. In other words, the function executed next time can see the changes made to the context by the function executed last time.
* JavaScript plug-ins can also access the Java classes and instances of the Turms server like Java plug-ins, and even call `System.exit()` directly, but it is not recommended to use JavaScript to write complex plug-ins
* Calling `Node.js` modules is not supported.

#### Main global object

* The `load` function is GraalVM's [global function](https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/js/JavaScriptCompatibility/#global-properties), used to load external JavaScript resources.
* `turms` object. This object mounts:
    * `log` object, used for log printing
    * `fetch` function, used to send HTTP requests

TODO

#### Plug-in Debug steps

In Debug mode (configure `turms.plugin.js.debug.enabled` to `true`, you can start Debug mode):

1. When the plug-in host Turms Java server calls the JavaScript plug-in function implemented by the proxy of the Java `Proxy` class (the proxy implementation source code is in: `im.turms.server.common.infra.plugin.JsExtensionPointInvocationHandler`), listen to JavaScript The WebSocket Debugger server of the plug-in will wait for the developer to start the Debugger of the Chrome browser to ensure that the JavaScript plug-in code will not be executed until the developer binds the Debugger. At this time, the Java calling thread that calls the JavaScript plug-in function will enter the `WAITING` state, and wait for the execution of the JavaScript plug-in function to complete.

2. In order to monitor the implementation of the JavaScript plug-in code, the developer needs to open the Chrome browser and enter the monitoring address of the WebSocket Debugger server that monitors the JavaScript plug-in. The developer can set a breakpoint for the JavaScript plug-in code on this page for debugging. Among them, the listening address of the server will be printed on the console by the Turms server, similar to:

   > Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:24242/bd62b7be-bdec-48a6-9ad0-9314af33d531
   > For help, see: https://www.graalvm.org/tools/chrome-debugger
   > E.g. in Chrome open: devtools://devtools/bundled/js_app.html?ws=127.0.0.1:24242/bd62b7be-bdec-48a6-9ad0-9314af33d531

   Among them, `devtools://devtools/bundled/js_app.html?ws=127.0.0.1:24242/bd62b7be-bdec-48a6-9ad0-9314af33d531` is the listening address.

3. After the Chrome Debugger is bound, the JavaScript plug-in function will start to execute

4. After the JavaScript plug-in function is executed, the Java calling thread will enter the `RUNNABLE` state, and the Java proxy function will then return the data returned by the JavaScript plug-in function.
