## User Relationship Hosting

concept:

- Relationship: Relationship is divided into one-way relationship and two-way relationship. One-way relationship refers to: the owner of the relationship (relationship owner) has a specific relationship with the Related User (relationship person), such as "one-way friend" (allowing the other party to send messages and friend requests) or "blocking User" (prohibit the other party from sending messages, friend requests, etc.). The establishment of a one-way relationship does not require permission authentication. A two-way relationship means that user A has a one-way relationship with user B, and user B has a one-way relationship with user A. For example, user A blocks user B, and user B can specify not to block user A.
- Related Users: Refers to users who have a one-way or two-way relationship (designate the other party as a friend or block the user). Two users are Strangers if they don't have a relationship of either kind.
- Relational person group: A relational person group consists of a group name and a group of related persons, and each relationship must exist in at least one related person group. If the client does not perform a group operation on the relationship when creating the relationship, the relationship will be put into the user's default relationship group. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the fact that there can be both "friends" and "blocked" users in "a related person group". Of course, you can restrict a group to only have a certain type of related person through business restrictions.

Additional supplement: In fact, there is no such concept as "friend/block user" in the Turms domain model, and its essence is a bool called "isBlocked".

| Add a relationship (+initiate a friend request)        | ①If adding a relationship as a "friend", according to your customized Turms server configuration, the user can either directly add a "friend" relationship, or initiate a friend request first , the operation of adding a "friend" relationship will not be performed automatically until the requestee's approval is obtained. <br />② If you add a related person whose relationship is "block user", no approval is required and it will take effect directly. Users will no longer receive any messages or requests from blocked users. | turms.service.user.friend-request.content-limit<br />turms.service.user.friend-request.delete-expired-requests-when-cron-triggered<br />turms.service.user.friend -request.allow-send-request-after-declined-or-ignored-or-expired<br />turms.service.user.friend-request.friend-request-expire-after-seconds<br />turms.service .user.friend-request.expired-user-friend-requests-cleanup-cron<br />turms.service.user.friend-request.delete-expired-requests-when-cron-triggered |
