# Multi-terminal login

## Login device identification strategy

1. Manual configuration. The developer can manually configure the specific login device type when calling the `turmsClient.userService.login()` interface of the client. For an actual iOS device, specify to log in as `Android` (this operation is allowed). In addition, you can also manually configure the login device type as `UNKNOWN`.
2. Default configuration. If you do not manually configure the specific login device type, by default, each Turms client will automatically identify the current operating environment and specify the current login device type.
   * turms-client-js will determine whether the current operating environment is a browser or Node.js, if it is a browser, log in as `Browser`, otherwise log in as `Desktop`
   * turms-client-kotlin will judge whether the current operating environment is Android or desktop system, and log in as `Android` and `Desktop` respectively
   * turms-client-swift logs in as `iOS` by default

**Notice**

- Any type of multi-terminal login does not allow a user account to have multiple simultaneous login devices on one device
- When the type of user login device has `Unkown` or `Others`, additional configuration is required, that is, whether to allow `Unkown`/`Others` devices to log in with other known devices at the same time
