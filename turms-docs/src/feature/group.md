## Group type configuration

In terms of group configuration, Turms uses the concept of "group types". By default, Turms provides a general group type, and you can also add, delete, modify and query the "group type" to meet your customized group type needs.

Corresponding admin API: `/groups/types`. For specific API details, please refer to the OpenAPI documentation
Corresponding configuration model: `im.turms.service.domain.group.po.GroupType`

remind:

* There is no mutually exclusive relationship between the above "invitation policy", "invitee consent mode" and "group policy", and they are all compatible with each other, so developers can match them according to their own application scenarios .

* If the administrator modifies the invitation policy or joining policy of a group type, which leads to a change in the policy corresponding to the group, the data corresponding to the old policy will be archived and will not be deleted by the system. Authorized users can still delete, modify and query these data.

  For example, a group originally allowed new users to join the group based on the policy of "approving group entry requests", and the group has received some group entry requests. If the system administrator (note: users do not have permission to modify the group type) modify the group policy to "question-and-answer based" policy to allow new users to join the group, then the previously received request to join the group will not be deleted by the system. When the group administrator tries to approve these group entry requests, the server will also notify the group policy of the change and reject the approval. But group administrators can still delete, modify and query these group requests.

  In addition, some users may think that the group policy of Turms is more complicated, but this kind of "complexity" has nothing to do with users. Users only need to configure according to their own application scenarios. It is very simple to use, just the development of Turms It is more complicated to implement these dynamic combination strategies.

* We have no plan to support the feature of "users block groups to refuse to receive group invitations and be pulled into groups".

## Scene introduction

### User joins a group

1. The client queries the group information of the specified group through `turmsClient.groupService.queryGroups(...)`.

2. Obtain group type information based on the relationship between the local hard-coded group type ID and group type information.

   Replenish:

    * Here, the client does not support dynamic query of group type information because the group type of most applications is fixed, and there is no need to dynamically pull information.
    * If your application only uses one group type, you can directly hard-code the group type information on the client side, skip steps ① and ②, and go directly to the next step.

3. According to the group entry policy in the group type information, determine which client API needs to be called to join the group:

    * If it is `JOIN_REQUEST` policy, you need to call `turmsClient.groupService.createJoinRequest(...)` to send the request to join the group, and wait for the approval of the group administrator.
    * If it is `QUESTION` strategy, you need to call `turmsClient.groupService.queryGroupJoinQuestions(...)` to query group questions, and then use `turmsClient.groupService.answerGroupQuestions(...)` to answer group questions, when the score reaches After the group administrator sets the entry threshold, you can automatically join the group.
    * If it is `MEMBERSHIP_REQUEST` policy, call `turmsClient.groupService.joinGroup(...)` to directly join the group without any approval.
    * If it is `INVITATION` strategy, you need to wait for the group administrator to send the current user an invitation to join the group.
